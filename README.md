FizzBuzz Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic FizzBuzz game in Python. 
The program prints the numbers from 1 to a target number (default is 100), but for multiples of three, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, 
and for the multiples of five, it prints "Buzz". 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, it prints "FizzBuzz".
